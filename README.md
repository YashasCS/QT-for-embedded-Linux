# QT-for-embedded-Linux
This repo is created to serve as an example folder for people who wish to create free GUI applications on any JETSON microprocessor. 

For developing GUI for any application on Linux kernels, no GUI softwares are free. Initially I tested with LVGL since it was light weight and did not require any cross-compilers like on windows.
